{"name":"Dsvr","tagline":"Domain-Specific-VPN-Router","body":"DSVR (Domain-Specific VPN Router)\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\n**PURPOSE**\r\n\r\nIf you're using a VPN service today, you may have found the following limitations:  \r\n\r\n1) All or nothing. Either ALL traffic goes down the VPN or none - unable to be selective.  \r\n2) Only one VPN at a time. Cannot selectively route certain sites down one VPN, and others down another VPN.  \r\n3) Unless you've configured your VPN at the router level, it's likely that only a single device can use your VPN at one time.  \r\n\r\nThis project serves to address each of the above...  \r\n\r\n**FEATURES**\r\n\r\n![ScreenShot](http://s21.postimg.org/hram13auf/dsvr_logical_v0_2.png)\r\n![ScreenShot](http://s22.postimg.org/6rg7xnif5/dsvr_physical_v0_2.png)\r\n\r\n1) Per-site VPN routing down specific VPN connections whilst all other traffic goes down the native internet connection, for example:  \r\n\r\n  \tussite1.com -> United States based PPTP VPN  \r\n\tussite2.com -> United States based PPTP VPN  \r\n\tuksite1.com -> United Kingdom based PPTP VPN  \r\n\tuksite2.com -> United Kingdom based PPTP VPN  \r\n\tallothersites -> Native internet connection  \r\n\r\n2) Supports multiple concurrent PPTP connections  \r\n3) Transparent in-line device - no configuration changes required on any other network components or clients  \r\n4) User specified DNS server for per-site DNS queries, for privacy from your ISP.  \r\n5) Stateful firewall (SPI)  \r\n6) CLI access via SSH  \r\n7) Web administration portal  \r\n\r\n![ScreenShot](http://s11.postimg.org/mo6lurjyr/screenshot1.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n**PRE-REQUISTES**\r\n\r\nExisting:  \r\n1) Separate Modem/CE device with ethernet and DHCP server  \r\n2) Separate Router/AP to provide Wifi/Wired access to clients  \r\n3) Minimum of one PPTP VPN account from a service provider. Else it'll just be a pass-through router/firewall.  \r\n\r\nNew components required:  \r\n1) Raspberry Pi (Model B, 512mb RAM)  \r\n2) SD Card (4gb min) flashed with Raspbian Wheezy  \r\n3) Power source for Raspberry Pi  \r\n4) USB NIC adapter (suggest Apple model: A1277)  \r\n5) Standard Ethernet cable  \r\n\r\n**KNOWN LIMITATIONS**\r\n\r\n1) Theoretical 100mbit/s - likely less due to RPi using USB bus.  \r\n2) Port forwarding to existing router not in place. (see TODO)  \r\n3) Cannot perform source-based VPN routing without removal of existing NAT boundary, so that real sources can be determined.  \r\n4) Currently assumes your LAN subnet is 192.168.1.0 (see TODO)  \r\n5) Currently only support PPTP based VPNs (see TODO)  \r\n   \r\n**TESTED WITH**  \r\n\r\n1) StrongVPN PPTP VPN accounts  \r\n\r\n**INSTALLATION**  \r\n\r\n1) Flash your SD card with Raspbain (Wheezy)  \r\n2) Boot-up your RPi with the on-board NIC plugged into your network (without the USB NIC module installed), to obtain a DHCP address  \r\n3) Determine the RPi IP address (hint: look at your router web interface), and SSH into it - ssh pi@<ipaddress>  \r\n4) Copy the dnsrouter-xxx.tar.gz into your home folder (/home/pi) - copy using FTP over SSH (SFTP) (e.g. Cyberduck)  \r\n5) Extract the tar file, cd into it's directory  \r\n6) Run the install script with sudo - sudo ./installscript.sh - take note of any errors that may come up. This will take a while, as it will be installing a number of packages via the web.  \r\n7) Follow the prompts, and once it completes issue the 'shutdown -h -t now' command to power-down the RPi  \r\n8) With the power-off, plug the USB NIC into an available USB port.  \r\n9) Wire your RPI inline between your existing Modem/CE and your existing Router/Access Point as follows:  \r\n\r\n    eth0 (onboard) is 'internet side'\r\n    eth1 (usb) is 'lan side'\r\n\r\n\r\n                        eth (inside)      eth (wan)\r\n                        DHCP Server       DHCP Client\r\n      +-----+           +                 NAT (Hide)        +-----+\r\n      | P   |           |                 +                 | I   |\r\n      | U   |           |                 |                 | N   |\r\n      | B I |           |                 |                 | T C |\r\n      | L N |    +------+   +---------+   +------------+    | E L |\r\n      | I T |<---+Modem/|<--+Raspberry|<--+Router/     |<---+ R I |\r\n      | C E |    |CE    |   |Pi       |   |Access Point|    | N E |\r\n      |   R |    +------+   +---------+   +------------+    | A N |\r\n      |   N |               |         |                     | L T |\r\n      |   E |               |         +                     |   S |\r\n      |   T |               |         eth1 (usb)            |     |\r\n      +-----+               |         10.254.254.254        +-----+\r\n                            +         DHCP Server\r\n               eth0 (onboard)         Web admin server\r\n                  DHCP Client         SSH server\r\n                   NAT (Hide)         VPN gateway\r\n\r\n10) Power-up the RPi, whilst it's booting power-down and power-up both your Modem/CE and your Router/Access Point  \r\n11) Wait a while for things to come up, I'd guess around 3-5mins  \r\n12) On your Router/Access Point verify that the WAN interface has received a DHCP lease from the RPi, something in the 10.254.254.x range  \r\n13) Verify that the internet is still working from your client machines. If not wait a while longer, else something has gone wrong.  \r\n14) Verify you can ssh to your RPi - ssh pi@10.254.254.254, verify that the RPi can access the internet both via IP and DNS.  \r\n15) Verify that you pass the ShieldsUp! (www.grc.com/shieldsup) stealth test, this is to test the SPI firewall is functional.  \r\n\r\nThe device should be a functional pass-through router/firewall at this point, see the next section to setup per-site VPNs.  \r\n\r\n**VPN CONFIGURATION**  \r\n\r\n1) Browse to http://10.254.254.254  \r\n2) Click 'add' to add a PPTP VPN connection  \r\n3) Input all fields, and specify which sites you want to be routed down this connection, suggest you include a unique 'ip address checker' (aruljohn.com, strongvpn.com) site for each - this will help in verifying it's functional  \r\n4) Click 'update', then 'back'  \r\n5) Repeat 2-4 for each required PPTP VPN.  \r\n6) Reboot router  \r\n7) Wait - maybe 3-5mins, then test that per-site VPN routing is functional. If you included a unique 'ip address checker' site for each connection, this is the best initial test.  \r\n\r\nShould be working now. Enjoy.  \r\n\r\n**TODO**\r\n\r\n1) Short Term  \r\n\r\n  \t-'DMZ' for inside interface to circumvent dbl-nat issues (e.g. uPnP, port forwarding, VPN server)  \r\n\r\n\tInstall script  \r\n\t- Run/debug and fix.  \r\n\t- Add Y/N prompt to explain what needs to happen once it completes (wiring, IP to connect to, setup PPTP connections)  \r\n\r\n\tPackage script  \r\n\t- create scripts to refresh files in installstubs/  \r\n\t- create VERSION file based on provided arg[0]  \r\n\r\n\tWeb admin  \r\n\t- Allow hostname OR IP address input/parsing/encoding for peer VPN server.  \r\n\t- Read and display VERSION file  \r\n\r\n\tdnsrouter  \r\n\t- Read and display VERSION file  \r\n\r\n2) Medium Term  \r\n    \r\n\t- make webadmin look better on iPad webkit browser  \r\n\t- form input validation  \r\n\t- Authentication for webadmin  \r\n\t- WAN side MAC address 'cloning', required for some ISPs\r\n\r\n3) Long Term  \r\n    \r\n\t- Add support for OpenVPN  \r\n\t- Allow change from 10.254.254.254 inside default (remember dhcpd.conf and DNSRouter init changes needed too!)  \r\n\t- Installer to prompt user for variables such as - inside IP address, LAN segment, install location  \r\n\t- don't assume 192.168.1.0 is LAN segment for routes and iptables  \r\n\r\n**LINKS**  \r\n    \r\n\t- ASCII diagram (http://www.asciiflow.com/#Draw8450497916007412677/1697158644)  \r\n\t- To properly calc memory usage due to disk caching - http://www.linuxatemyram.com/index.html  \r\n\r\n**CREDIT**\r\n\r\n    Portions of code taken from the dnschef project (https://thesprawl.org/projects/dnschef/)\r\n\r\n    Copyright (C) 2013 Peter Kacherginsky\r\n    All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n**LICENSE**\r\n\r\n    DSVR (Domain Specific VPN Router)\r\n    Copyright 2013 Darran Boyd\r\n     \r\n    Licensed under the \"Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike\" Vizsage\r\n    Public License (the \"License\").
