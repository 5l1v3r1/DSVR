<p><strong>PURPOSE</strong></p>

<p>If you're using a VPN service today, you may have found the following limitations:  </p>

<p>1) All or nothing. Either ALL traffic goes down the VPN or none - unable to be selective.<br>
2) Only one VPN at a time. Cannot selectively route certain sites down one VPN, and others down another VPN.<br>
3) Unless you've configured your VPN at the router level, it's likely that only a single device can use your VPN at one time.  </p>

<p>This project serves to address each of the above...  </p>

<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://s21.postimg.org/hram13auf/dsvr_logical_v0_2.png" alt="ScreenShot"><img src="http://s22.postimg.org/6rg7xnif5/dsvr_physical_v0_2.png" alt="ScreenShot"></p>

<p>1) Per-site VPN routing down specific VPN connections whilst all other traffic goes down the native internet connection, for example:  </p>

<pre><code>ussite1.com -&gt; United States based PPTP VPN  
ussite2.com -&gt; United States based PPTP VPN  
uksite1.com -&gt; United Kingdom based PPTP VPN  
uksite2.com -&gt; United Kingdom based PPTP VPN  
allothersites -&gt; Native internet connection  
</code></pre>

<p>2) Supports multiple concurrent PPTP connections<br>
3) Transparent in-line device - no configuration changes required on any other network components or clients<br>
4) User specified DNS server for per-site DNS queries, for privacy from your ISP.<br>
5) Stateful firewall (SPI)<br>
6) CLI access via SSH<br>
7) Web administration portal  </p>

<p><img src="http://s11.postimg.org/mo6lurjyr/screenshot1.jpg" alt="ScreenShot"></p>

<p><strong>PRE-REQUISTES</strong></p>

<p>Existing:<br>
1) Separate Modem/CE device with ethernet and DHCP server<br>
2) Separate Router/AP to provide Wifi/Wired access to clients<br>
3) Minimum of one PPTP VPN account from a service provider. Else it'll just be a pass-through router/firewall.  </p>

<p>New components required:<br>
1) Raspberry Pi (Model B, 512mb RAM)<br>
2) SD Card (4gb min) flashed with Raspbian Wheezy<br>
3) Power source for Raspberry Pi<br>
4) USB NIC adapter (suggest Apple model: A1277)<br>
5) Standard Ethernet cable  </p>

<p><strong>KNOWN LIMITATIONS</strong></p>

<p>1) Theoretical 100mbit/s - likely less due to RPi using USB bus.<br>
2) Port forwarding to existing router not in place. (see TODO)<br>
3) Cannot perform source-based VPN routing without removal of existing NAT boundary, so that real sources can be determined.<br>
4) Currently assumes your LAN subnet is 192.168.1.0 (see TODO)<br>
5) Currently only support PPTP based VPNs (see TODO)  </p>

<p><strong>TESTED WITH</strong>  </p>

<p>1) StrongVPN PPTP VPN accounts  </p>

<p><strong>INSTALLATION</strong>  </p>

<p>1) Flash your SD card with Raspbain (Wheezy)<br>
2) Boot-up your RPi with the on-board NIC plugged into your network (without the USB NIC module installed), to obtain a DHCP address<br>
3) Determine the RPi IP address (hint: look at your router web interface), and SSH into it - ssh pi@<br>
4) Copy the dnsrouter-xxx.tar.gz into your home folder (/home/pi) - copy using FTP over SSH (SFTP) (e.g. Cyberduck)<br>
5) Extract the tar file, cd into it's directory<br>
6) Run the install script with sudo - sudo ./installscript.sh - take note of any errors that may come up. This will take a while, as it will be installing a number of packages via the web.<br>
7) Follow the prompts, and once it completes issue the 'shutdown -h -t now' command to power-down the RPi<br>
8) With the power-off, plug the USB NIC into an available USB port.<br>
9) Wire your RPI inline between your existing Modem/CE and your existing Router/Access Point as follows:  </p>

<pre><code>eth0 (onboard) is 'internet side'
eth1 (usb) is 'lan side'


                    eth (inside)      eth (wan)

               NAT (Hide)         VPN gateway
</code></pre>

<p>10) Power-up the RPi, whilst it's booting power-down and power-up both your Modem/CE and your Router/Access Point<br>
11) Wait a while for things to come up, I'd guess around 3-5mins<br>
12) On your Router/Access Point verify that the WAN interface has received a DHCP lease from the RPi, something in the 10.254.254.x range<br>
13) Verify that the internet is still working from your client machines. If not wait a while longer, else something has gone wrong.<br>
14) Verify you can ssh to your RPi - ssh pi@10.254.254.254, verify that the RPi can access the internet both via IP and DNS.<br>
15) Verify that you pass the ShieldsUp! (<a href="http://www.grc.com/shieldsup">www.grc.com/shieldsup</a>) stealth test, this is to test the SPI firewall is functional.  </p>

<p>The device should be a functional pass-through router/firewall at this point, see the next section to setup per-site VPNs.  </p>

<p><strong>VPN CONFIGURATION</strong>  </p>

<p>1) Browse to <a href="http://10.254.254.254">http://10.254.254.254</a><br>
2) Click 'add' to add a PPTP VPN connection<br>
3) Input all fields, and specify which sites you want to be routed down this connection, suggest you include a unique 'ip address checker' (aruljohn.com, strongvpn.com) site for each - this will help in verifying it's functional<br>
4) Click 'update', then 'back'<br>
5) Repeat 2-4 for each required PPTP VPN.<br>
6) Reboot router<br>
7) Wait - maybe 3-5mins, then test that per-site VPN routing is functional. If you included a unique 'ip address checker' site for each connection, this is the best initial test.  </p>

<p>Should be working now. Enjoy.  </p>

<p><strong>TODO</strong></p>

<p>1) Short Term  </p>

<pre><code>-'DMZ' for inside interface to circumvent dbl-nat issues (e.g. uPnP, port forwarding, VPN server)  

Install script  
- Run/debug and fix.  
- Add Y/N prompt to explain what needs to happen once it completes (wiring, IP to connect to, setup PPTP connections)  

Package script  
- create scripts to refresh files in installstubs/  
- create VERSION file based on provided arg[0]  

Web admin  
- Allow hostname OR IP address input/parsing/encoding for peer VPN server.  
- Read and display VERSION file  

dnsrouter  
- Read and display VERSION file  
</code></pre>

<p>2) Medium Term  </p>

<pre><code>- make webadmin look better on iPad webkit browser  
- form input validation  
- Authentication for webadmin  
- WAN side MAC address 'cloning', required for some ISPs
</code></pre>

<p>3) Long Term  </p>

<pre><code>- Add support for OpenVPN  
- Allow change from 10.254.254.254 inside default (remember dhcpd.conf and DNSRouter init changes needed too!)  
- Installer to prompt user for variables such as - inside IP address, LAN segment, install location  
- don't assume 192.168.1.0 is LAN segment for routes and iptables  
</code></pre>
